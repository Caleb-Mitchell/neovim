# Personal Neovim config

Many thanks to [Chris@machine](https://github.com/ChristianChiarulli) for his
excellent youtube playlist [youtube playist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhoH5vyxr6Qq41NFL4GvhFp-WLd5xzIzZ)  detailing how to build a functional IDE-like neovim setup from scratch in lua.

> `:helptags ALL` will generate for all plugins then you can just type like :h lualine and get the lualine docs in vim
